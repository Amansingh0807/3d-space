# 🌌 3D Space UI — Interactive Solar System Inspired Interface

This is a side project where I implemented my learnings in **Three.js**, **Framer Motion**, and **WebGL** to build a visually appealing and interactive 3D space interface. It features a central rotating sphere (inspired by the solar system) surrounded by smaller celestial-like spheres, all responsive to cursor motion.

## ✨ Project Overview

The UI replicates a minimalistic cosmic scene. When users move their cursor, the large central sphere gently rotates in real-time, simulating a realistic motion effect. Smaller spheres are positioned around it, giving the impression of planetary bodies orbiting in 3D space.

This project showcases animation, spatial design, and cursor interactivity — all rendered smoothly through **React Three Fiber**, **@react-three/drei**, and **Framer Motion**.

## 💡 Inspiration
This project was born out of my passion for 3D interfaces and immersive visual experiences. It combines interactive design with spatial animation to create a visually engaging UI element that could be used in creative portfolios, hero sections, or conceptual demos.
